# B+ Tree
 ========

This code is based on another open-source B+ tree. 

https://github.com/zcbenz/BPlusTree (Thank you, Zhao Chenk, for helping to learn new thing >3)

----- 
 
This is my B+Tree implementation.
I have done everything in my power to make the code _practical and close to reality_.

My implementation is based on __storing data in a file__, which allows you to work with big data.

"BPlusTree.hpp" is the header file of B+ Tree. The main implementation: see in "BPlusTree.cpp"
